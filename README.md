# Life Skins
A mod for changing player skins depending on the life amount without needing to restart  Minecraft! Requires the [Life Series](https://modrinth.com/mod/life-series/) mod for lives tracking! Also requires [Fabric Tailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrictailor/) to run properly (Hoping to make it optional in a future update)

## How to use
Running the /skin reload command will update your skin 
## How to set up
### Advanced
## Extra info
I plan to mainly release versions I myself am going to play on, so I will most likely skip a few. If there's a particular version you'd like me to release a mod version for, feel free to contact me either on Discord(my username is dianacraft) or by creating an issue on [Github](https://github.com/DianacraftGaming/lifeskins/issues) and I'll see if I can get that done for you
Thanks for enjoying the mod!
